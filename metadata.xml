    <description>Did you ever wish you could restart / quick reset from your controller / gamepad?
Worry not, just pull both triggers on your xbox controller and be happy!

To be precise, this mod restarts / quick resets the game when you hold down the key to use items and the key to drop your stuff for about the same time you would need to press &quot;r&quot; on the keyboard.
Limited to controllers and limited to the controller that player 1 uses.

If you want to change the buttons, find the main.lua of this mod and change the variables button1 and button2, the list of possible values is in the file.

Have fun rerolling!</description>
